Screensaver fooling with pyautogui / Personal practice for creating an executable from python

Corporate PCs in general come with fixed screensaver settings, which can be beneficial for the corporate's safety but meanwhile quite disrupting for the individual's automation attempt.
Pyautogui is used for a few lines of code to fool the screensaver through mouse movement. 
This project is mostly a personal practice for executable file generation from python.
